# Python API for JitBit Helpdesk Integration

Implements most of the functionality listed in [their API docs](https://www.jitbit.com/helpdesk/helpdesk-api/), 
though not much of the actual ticket stuff because I didn't need it. Feel free to add that if you do :). I've
listed the newest version of [requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/) just for safety's sake. If
your project uses something older, you're probably fine, but check the changelog for any security updates
that may have happened between now and then.
